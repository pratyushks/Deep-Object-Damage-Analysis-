# Deep-Object-Damage-Analysis-
The project involves the development of a machine learning model that is trained to classify images of cars as "damaged" or "undamaged". 
The purpose of this model could be to automate the process of detecting and categorizing damage to vehicles in images, 
which could be useful in various industries such as insurance and automotive repair.
The dataset used to train and validate the model consists of images of cars, which are split into training and validation sets. 
To improve the performance of the model, data augmentation techniques are applied to the training set, 
which artificially increase the size of the dataset by creating modified versions of the original images. 
The modified versions are created by applying various transformations such as rotation, zoom, and shear.
The CNN model used for classification consists of several layers, including convolutional layers, max pooling layers, 
and fully connected layers. The convolutional layers are responsible for extracting features from the input images, 
while the fully connected layers perform the actual classification based on the extracted features. 
The output layer uses a sigmoid activation function, 
which outputs a probability between 0 and 1 indicating the likelihood that an image is classified as "damaged".
The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function, 
which are common choices for binary classification problems. 
The accuracy of the model is monitored during training, and after training is complete, 
the model is evaluated on the validation set to assess its performance. Finally, the trained model is saved for future use.
